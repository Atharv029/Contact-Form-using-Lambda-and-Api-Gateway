üöÄ **Building Serverless Solutions with AWS Lambda & API Gateway** üåê

In my latest project, I implemented a **serverless architecture** using **AWS Lambda** to handle requests, bypass CORS issues, and **store data in a database**, creating a seamless integration between frontend and backend.

**Key Highlights:**
- **AWS Lambda** for running backend logic.
- **API Gateway** for exposing the Lambda function as a REST API.
- **Database Integration**: Stored and retrieved data from a database, ensuring persistence across requests.
- Configured **CORS** (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to handle frontend requests without security concerns.
- Showcased my ability to work with **serverless technologies**, **cloud platforms**, and **database integration**.

This solution not only improves scalability but also ensures data persistence while reducing costs by eliminating the need for a dedicated server. It‚Äôs a perfect example of how modern serverless solutions can solve common development challenges like CORS and data storage.

# Serverless CORS Handling with AWS Lambda and Database Integration

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to set up a **serverless backend** using **AWS Lambda**, **API Gateway**, and a **database** to bypass CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues and store data, allowing seamless interaction between frontend and backend.

### Key Features:
- **AWS Lambda** function to process requests.
- **API Gateway** to expose the Lambda function as a RESTful API.
- **CORS** headers configured within the Lambda function to allow cross-origin requests.
- **Database Integration**: Data is stored in a database, ensuring persistence across multiple requests.
- A simple HTML frontend to interact with the serverless backend.

### Problem:
Handling CORS issues is a common challenge when making requests to APIs hosted on different domains. This project showcases a solution using serverless technologies to eliminate the need for complex server management, solve CORS problems, and store data in a database for persistence.

### How It Works:
1. **Frontend (HTML/JavaScript)**:
   - An HTML page with a button that triggers a fetch request to the API.
   - The fetch call interacts with the API Gateway, which triggers the AWS Lambda function and stores data in the database.

2. **Backend (AWS Lambda + API Gateway + Database)**:
   - **AWS Lambda** processes the incoming request, performs necessary logic, and interacts with the database to store or retrieve data.
   - **CORS headers** are added to the Lambda function response, allowing cross-origin requests.
   - **API Gateway** serves as the endpoint that triggers the Lambda function, making the entire process serverless.
   - The Lambda function is connected to a **database** where data is stored and fetched as needed.

### Steps to Deploy:
1. Deploy the AWS Lambda function with the provided code.
2. Set up an API Gateway with CORS enabled to trigger the Lambda function.
3. Configure the Lambda function to interact with your database (e.g., DynamoDB, RDS).
4. Update the API URL in the HTML frontend to point to your API Gateway endpoint.
5. Test the integration by opening the HTML file in a browser and clicking the "Fetch Data" button.

### Technologies Used:
- AWS Lambda (Node.js)
- AWS API Gateway
- CORS
- Database Integration (e.g., DynamoDB)
- HTML, JavaScript (Frontend)
